# simple-js-tidbits
A bunch of JS tidbits to get more familiar with JS and to use as reference if needed

This is a course from www.freecodecamp.com 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/

This course is very simple in the way of JS so I decided to add my own flare to it


## React element
I didn't like the way there was every project had its own file structure, so I decided to throw some react in and make each project its own tile.
